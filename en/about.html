                        <p><i>Horsopia Internationale</i>, born in France — a land steeped in equestrian tradition and artistic culture — is a cross-cultural equestrian platform devoted to connecting China and Europe through the power of the horse.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since 2019, we have been committed to building bridges between Chinese and European equestrian communities. In 2025, we officially registered at the police prefecture of Champigny-sur-Marne, marking a new milestone in our journey.</p>
                        
                        <p>Beyond our love for riding itself, we are dedicated to promoting equestrian culture and advancing the sustainable development of the equestrian industry. Horsopia’s work centers around two pillars:</strong></p>
                        
<div class="core-pillars">
  <div class="pillar">
    <p><strong>📘 Education & Training: </strong> We introduce standardized European riding education, partnering with prestigious equestrian schools in France, the Netherlands, and beyond. Our tiered, age-appropriate programs include youth training camps, adult advancement courses, and elite private coaching — all tailored to meet riders’ needs at various stages.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pillar">
    <p><strong>🌐 Sino-French Exchange: </strong> We support Chinese equestrian institutions by bringing in certified French national coaches, sport horses, and training systems. We also facilitate multilevel exchange opportunities across coach development, rider education, and equine trade, fostering deeper collaboration and knowledge-sharing between China and France.</p>
  </div>
</div>                        
                        <p>Over the past six years, we have built strong, trusted relationships with professional institutions, coaches, and riders across France, while actively strengthening our ties with the Chinese equestrian world. Looking forward, we aim to help more people connect through horses, grow with horses, and find a sense of belonging, courage, and purpose within the equestrian realm.</p>
